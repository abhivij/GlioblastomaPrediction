!Series_summary	"We report RNA-sequencing data of 779 blood platelet samples, including 402 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 377 individuals without reported cancer, but not excluding individuals with inflammatory conditions. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsy' diagnostics in patients with NSCLC."
!Series_overall_design	"Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the humane reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."

Samples with detectable fragments in the 300-7500 bp region were selected for further processing and Covaris shearing by sonication (Covaris Inc). Sample preparation for Illumina sequencing was performed using the Truseq DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr. FC-121-2001) or Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, cat nr. FC-121-4001). Sample quality and quantity was measured using the DNA 7500 chip or DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent). High-quality samples with product sizes between 300-500 bp were pooled in equimolar concentrations (12-19 samples per Hiseq lane) and submitted for 100 bp Single Read sequencing on the Hiseq 2500 platform (Illumina)."
